      <h2>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948): A Biography</h2>
      <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi or Bapu, was born on October 2, 1869, in
        Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Raised in a devout Hindu family, Gandhi's principles of truth, nonviolence, and
        self-discipline were instilled in him from an early age.</p>
      <p>Gandhi studied law in London and later practiced in South Africa, where he became an advocate for civil rights,
        fighting against racial discrimination. It was during this time that he developed the concept of nonviolent
        resistance, which he later termed "Satyagraha."</p>
      <p>Returning to India in 1915, Gandhi emerged as a prominent leader in the Indian National Congress, advocating
        for India's independence from British rule. His philosophy of nonviolence and civil disobedience became the
        guiding force behind the Indian independence movement.</p>
      <p>Tragically, on January 30, 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who
        opposed Gandhi's tolerant views. Despite his physical absence, Gandhi's legacy endures, inspiring generations
        with his teachings of truth, love, and nonviolence.</p>
      <p> Gandhi's birthday, October 2nd, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti, and his philosophy continues to be a guiding
        light for those who seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and social injustices.</p>
